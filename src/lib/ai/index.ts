The potato trick works for soups and stews where the potato can absorb salt from the liquid, but it's less effective for thick curries. If you're making an Indian curry, try adding a tablespoon of cream or yogurt as well — dairy proteins also bind to sodium.";

A pinch of sugar also helps by activating sweet receptors that partially suppress the heat signal.

For a quicker fix, make a slurry: mix 1 tbsp cornstarch with 2 tbsp cold water (must be cold or it clumps), then stir it in. For Indian curries specifically, cashew paste or tomato paste are better thickeners than cornstarch — they add body without the starchy texture. Another trick: grate half a potato directly into the curry and simmer for 5 minutes — the starch thickens naturally.";

If you've seasoned well and it's still flat, the issue is likely that spices weren't bloomed properly. Toast 1 tsp of whole cumin or coriander seeds in a dry pan for 30 seconds until fragrant, crush, and stir in. For umami depth, a teaspoon of soy sauce works magic even in non-Asian dishes.";

If it's a tomato-based sauce, add more crushed tomatoes to dilute.

For rice, place a slice of white bread on top, cover, and let it sit for 10 minutes — the bread absorbs the burnt aroma.

Use about 85% of the butter amount since ghee is more concentrated. The only difference you'll notice: slightly nuttier aroma and the sauce won't have that creamy, emulsified quality that whole butter gives.

The tanginess is slightly more pronounced than regular yogurt, which actually enhances the overall flavor profile.

However, the core spice profile (garam masala, kasuri methi, cumin) is completely untouched, so the dish still tastes like Butter Chicken — just a lighter version. Practical tip: reduce the cream last and by the smallest amount possible, since cream contributes more to the signature than cooking oil does.
